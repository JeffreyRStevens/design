# Side-effects

withr.

## Return value

If your function is called primarily for its side-effects, it should return the primary data structure (which should be first argument), invisibly. This allows you to call it mid-pipe for its side-effects while allow the primary data to continue flowing through the pipe.

If your function is called primarly to persistently alter global state, it should return the previous values. e.g. `options()`, `par()`. `on.exit()` pattern.
