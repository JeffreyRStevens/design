# (PART) Function interface {-}

# Introduction  {#function-interface  .unnumbered}

The interface (aka API) of a function describes its external interface, independent of its internal implementation. The interface of a function has the following main components:

* Name
* Inputs, i.e. the names and types of its arguments.
* Output, i.e. its return value.
* Errors
* Other side-effects

## Inputs

### Default values

* Data arguments should come before details arguments.
  Arguments without defaults should come before arguments with defaults.

* If an argument doesn't have a default, it should error when absent.

* Defaults should return the same answer when run interactively.

### Dots

* `...` should come in between data and details arguments.

* Avoid using `...` to save the user from typing `c()`

* Consider if other arguments need `.` prefix

* In S3 methods (and select other problems), ensure that all inputs
  in `...` are evaluated.
